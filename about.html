    <h1>About Politics</h1>
</header>
<main>
    <div class="first">
    <h1 class="heading_of_politics">Democratic System</h1>
    <p>India is the world’s largest democracy, with over 900 million eligible voters (as of 2024). It follows a parliamentary system of government based on the British model.
        The country has a multi-party system, with national parties like the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Indian National Congress (INC), and numerous regional parties playing significant roles.</p>
</div>
    <div class="first">
    <h1 class="heading_of_politics">Federal Structure</h1>
    <p>India follows a federal structure of governance, meaning power is shared between the central government (Union Government) and state governments.
        The Constitution of India outlines the division of powers between the Union and the states through the Union List, State List, and Concurrent List.<p>
</div>
    <div class="first">
    <h1 class="heading_of_politics">Key Political Institutions
    </h1>
    <p>The President of India is the head of state, but the role is largely ceremonial. The Prime Minister is the head of government and exercises executive powers.
        The Parliament of India is bicameral, consisting of the Lok Sabha (House of the People) and the Rajya Sabha (Council of States).
        The Supreme Court of India is the highest judicial body and plays a crucial role in interpreting the Constitution.
        <p>
</div>
    <div class="first">
    <h1 class="heading_of_politics">Major Political Parties
    </h1>
    <p>The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), a right-wing party, has been a dominant force in recent years, particularly under Prime Minister Narendra Modi. It has a strong ideological connection to Hindutva (Hindu nationalism).
        The Indian National Congress (INC), historically the dominant party in India’s independence movement, remains a significant political force, though its influence has waned in recent years.
        Regional parties like the Trinamool Congress (TMC), Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), and the Samajwadi Party (SP) play crucial roles in state politics.
        India also has several other regional parties that are important in states such as DMK (Tamil Nadu), BJD (Odisha), and YSR Congress (Andhra Pradesh).
        <p>
</div>
    <div class="first">
    <h1 class="heading_of_politics">Secularism

    </h1>
    <p>India is a secular country, meaning there is no state religion, and religious freedom is enshrined in the Constitution.
        However, religious tensions and issues related to Hindu-Muslim relations sometimes play a significant role in political discourse, with debates on issues like cow protection, citizenship laws, and religious conversions.
        <p>
</div>
    <div class="first">
    <h1 class="heading_of_politics">Caste and Identity Politics

    </h1>
    <p>Caste-based politics is a major feature in Indian politics, with political parties often seeking support from specific castes or communities.
        The Reservation system (affirmative action for Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, and Other Backward Classes) is a key issue in Indian politics and continues to be a subject of debate and reform.
        <p>
</div>
    <div class="first">
    <h1 class="heading_of_politics">Economic and Social Policy


    </h1>
    <p>Economic policies in India have ranged from socialist approaches (such as the license raj and state control over industries) to more liberal market-oriented reforms since the early 1990s.
        There is ongoing debate over economic inequality, poverty alleviation, job creation, and healthcare and education reforms.
        
        <p>
</div>
    <div class="first">
    <h1 class="heading_of_politics">National Security and Foreign Policy
    </h1>
    <p>India’s national security concerns include regional tensions with Pakistan, particularly over the Kashmir issue, and strategic relationships with China.
        India is a key player in South Asia and has an active role in multilateral organizations like the United Nations, the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa), and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO).
        India's foreign policy is increasingly characterized by a desire to position itself as a global power, with a focus on economic diplomacy and security concerns.<p>
</div>
    <div class="first">
    <h1 class="heading_of_politics">Corruption and Governance

    </h1>
    <p>Corruption has been a persistent challenge in Indian politics, with high-profile scandals involving politicians, bureaucrats, and business leaders.
        Anti-corruption movements (e.g., the India Against Corruption movement led by Anna Hazare) and judicial interventions have pushed for reforms in governance.
        <p>
</div>
    <div class="first">
    <h1 class="heading_of_politics"> Electoral System

    </h1>
    <p>India holds general elections every five years to elect members to the Lok Sabha (lower house of Parliament). The elections are based on first-past-the-post voting.
        The Election Commission of India plays a vital role in ensuring free and fair elections across the country.
        <p>
</div>
    <div class="first">
    <h1 class="heading_of_politics">  Regionalism and Identity Movements

    </h1>
    <p>India is a country of diverse regional identities, languages, and cultures. Issues like linguistic diversity, regional autonomy, and ethnic identity are important in several states.
        Movements for greater autonomy or independence have arisen in states like Kashmir, Nagaland, and Punjab.
        <p>
</div>
    <div class="first">
    <h1 class="heading_of_politics">  Social Movements
    </h1>
    <p>Social movements in India often focus on issues like women's rights, Dalit rights, environmental protection, and farmers' protests.
        In recent years, there have been major movements such as the 2019-2020 Farmers' Protest against farm laws, women's safety protests, and the LGBTQ+ rights movement.
        <p>
</div>
    <div class="first">
    <h1 class="heading_of_politics">  Youth and Technology

    </h1>
    <p>India has a large, youthful population, and issues such as youth unemployment, technology adoption, and digital governance are becoming increasingly significant in politics.
        Social media and digital platforms play a major role in shaping political narratives and public opinion, with both political parties and activists using these platforms to reach voters.
        
        <p>
</div>
    <div class="first">
    <h1 class="heading_of_politics">  Challenges and Reform

    </h1>
    <p>India's political system faces challenges such as bureaucratic inefficiency, violence during elections, religious intolerance, and growing polarization.
        Ongoing efforts to reform areas such as criminal justice, policing, judicial accountability, and political party financing are central to improving governance.
